The lead scoring case study has been handled through building a logistic regression model which models the probability of an event occurring by having log-odds for the lead conversion be linear combination of one or more independent features to meet the constraints as per business requirements. 
Sensitivity, Specificity and Accuracy values were above 80% thus model was fit for the requirement 
For test data also model performed well, meeting the target Sensitivity, Specificity and Accuracy scores of 80%
